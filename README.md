## Project Overview

This project aims to build a recommendation system that suggests suitable student loan options for students based on their demographics, financial status, educational details, and loan preferences. The system employs machine learning techniques using TensorFlow and Keras to create and evaluate a deep neural network model.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

1. **feature1, feature2, feature3**: Example features representing student information.
2. **credit_ranking**: The target variable indicating the student's credit ranking.

In a real-world scenario, the dataset would include detailed information such as student demographics, financial details, educational details, and loan preferences.

## Model Building

1. **Preprocessing**:

   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Scale the features using `StandardScaler`.

2. **Neural Network Architecture**:

   - Input layer: Number of features.
   - Hidden layers: Two layers with 10 and 5 neurons, respectively, using the ReLU activation function.
   - Output layer: One neuron with the sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

3. **Compilation**:

   - Optimizer: Adam.
   - Loss function: Binary cross-entropy.
   - Metrics: Accuracy.

4. **Training**:
   - Fit the model using 50 epochs with the training data.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model using the test data and display the classification report, including precision, recall, and f1-score.

## Usage

To use the model for predictions:

1. Load the model from the saved file.
2. Make predictions using the test data.
3. Save and display the predictions in a DataFrame.

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Data Privacy and Security**: Ensuring the protection of sensitive student information.
2. **Accurate Financial Assessment**: Recommending suitable loan options based on a comprehensive financial assessment.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a recommendation system for student loans using a deep neural network. The system can provide personalized loan recommendations based on detailed student profiles, improving the relevance and appropriateness of the suggested loan options.
